# Project4-Spotify 
# Spotify Machine Learning Analysis and Problem Solving


## Project Overview

Something amazing about spotify******************
- Analyzing data from 520 spotify users to understand what customer behaviors are indicators that lead to a Free User becoming a paid subscriber.
We tackle this problem by comparing behaviors of non-subscribers to those of subscribers by measuring 7 factors: age, gender, Spotify usage, prefered listening content, music time slot, music influential mood, music listening frequency.
We conduct these measurments via clustering and comparing graphs
The result is 14 scatter plots, where 7 plots examining the 7 factors in the non-subscriber group compared with 7 plots examining the same factors in the subscriber group.

Additionally, we are studying the subscriber group to identify which type of subscription seems to be the most popular

## How to Use and Interact with the Project
*************
### Setup and Installation
************

## Data Collection, Cleaning  and Transformation
1. **Data Sources**: Koggle: --------*************************
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Used Word, Excel, Python and Pandas to create a clean csv:**************************
   - Cleaned csv by removing irrelevant lots, converting currency from HKD to USD, and Splitting the Estimate column into Lower Estimate and Higher Estimate. â€‹***********
   - Created a price category classifying sales as passed, below, within, or above estimate
3. **Database Creation**: Stored the cleaned DataFrame in a SQLite database****************


## Database
The Sqlite database contains auction data with information about lots number, brand, type, color, leather, hardware, year manufactured, estimates, and realized prices.**********

## Ethical Considerations


Our project raises several ethical considerations related to data usage:

1. **Data Privacy**: We have been careful to  use publicly available anonymized Spotify consumer data that will not compromise the listener's privacy, ensuring no sensitive user information was exposed.

4. **Cultural Considerations**: Music consumption varies across cultures, and our analysis of this Spotify dataset may reflect regional preferences not representative of global trends. We've attempted to avoid cultural generalizations in our analysis.

We believe that transparent data analysis can help consumers and industry professionals make more informed decisions while being mindful of these ethical considerations.Bias Mitigation was addressed by critically evaluating data sources for fairness and transparency, and by cleaning the dataset in a considerate manner, minimizing skewed representations. Transparency was maintained by thoroughly documenting all processes, allowing for clear auditability and reproducibility.
